### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<div>
 <p>
Hi! I am a Full Stack Software Engineer located in the RTP area in North Carolina. I earned my Bachelor of Software Engineering degree at Edinburgh Napier University in 2017 and have since had 3+ years of experience working in the field.

I am proficient in Javascript, Python, Golang, PHP, Node.js, and more but I enjoy expanding my knowledge and building on experience with languages I already know and languages I don't have commercial experience in yet.

I have worked on many private projects (one of which involves machine learning) and commercial projects which I believe have allowed me to become a diverse developer.
